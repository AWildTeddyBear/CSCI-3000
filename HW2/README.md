# CSCI-3000 - Structured Programming II (C++) - Homework 2

### Prerequisites

What you'll need to compile and run my code:

```
G++ Compiler - Found in linux distros (Tested only on Ubuntu 16.06+ and with cygwin with G++ compiler on Windows 10)
```

### Compiling

**For this program, you need to compile with the following command:**

```
g++ -std=c++17 sha256.cpp CSCI-3000_HW2.cpp -o out
```

And to run your new compiled program:

```
./out
```

**NOTE: Please include ALL other files within this directory for this program to work correctly and compile.**

## Built With

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3dev) - My main editor for code -- **Highly Recommended**
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - Another code editor (Pretty handy for adding new things to it for extra uses)
* [Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) - Used for Windows ports (Win32 Apps)
