# CSCI-3000 - Structured Programming II (C++)

Since I decide to vastly overcomplicate all of the progams I make now (sort of a challenge, really), I've decided to upload my code.

## Getting Started

These programs are by no mean "okay" for any sort of production use. 
**Do not use my examples to create a big project for someone else (or yourself).**
These were meant for a Computer Science programming course in my college.

### Prerequisites

What you'll need to compile and run my code:

```
G++ Compiler - Found in linux distros (Tested only on Ubuntu 16.06+ and with cygwin with C++ compiler
```

### Compiling

At the header of each file that I upload (that contains `main()`) will include the require g++ command to compile the program.

Generally, the format is as follows to compile with G++.

```
g++ someprogram.cpp -o out
```

And to run your new compiled program:

```
./out
```

This should get you generally up and running for some of my programs -- however, I never know how in-depth I'll go with the program, so it may need extra parameters.

## Built With

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3dev) - My main editor for code -- **Highly Reccomended**
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - Another code editor (Pretty handy for adding new things to it for extra uses)
* [Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) - Used for Windows ports (Win32 Apps)

## Contributing

For now, I will not allow Pull Requests since this is more of code that is already finished.

However, if you can simplify it down and make it much more efficient -- let me know! I'll update it!
